# General plan. This file will contain all
# default key mappings.
#
# Everything after the first '#' is ignored.
# The '#' cannot be used in a keymapping.
#
# Each line will contain a sequence of one
# or more actions separated by commas followed
# by a colon, then will be followed by one
# or more characters (separated by spaces)
# that activate that sequence of actions
